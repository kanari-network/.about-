# about

**Kanari Network** is an open-source project designed to leverage the **Move Virtual Machine (Move VM)** to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient storage of file metadata within a **Web3** ecosystem. At its core, Kanari Network aims to address the growing needs of decentralized applications (dApps) that require reliable proof of file authenticity and ownership in a permissionless and trustless manner.

By using Move VM—originally introduced by the Diem (formerly Libra) project—Kanari Network can execute smart contracts that handle metadata-specific logic. This includes hash validation, file naming, and access management, all backed by on-chain records. These transactions form a transparent trail of changes that can be easily verified, ensuring every update to the metadata is backed by verifiable cryptographic proof. This design allows developers to focus on building new features without compromising the security and reliability of file tracking.

In practical terms, Kanari Network focuses on making decentralized storage more versatile and organized. While many solutions in the Web3 space address the challenges of large file storage via peer-to-peer approaches (e.g., IPFS), the actual metadata—like file ownership, timestamps, version histories, and potential file governance—often sits in separate databases or off-chain systems. Kanari Network tightens that gap by anchoring all relevant details on-chain, thus giving users immutable references that point to the location of the file data itself. 

Developers can integrate with Kanari Network through its open-source libraries and APIs. These tools streamline the process of registering files, updating metadata, and retrieving updated records from anywhere in the world. Furthermore, the project’s open-source nature fosters collaboration, allowing developers to contribute improvements, propose new features, and maintain robust governance.

In sum, Kanari Network provides an effective means of ensuring that file metadata remains accessible, secure, and verifiable. By leveraging the flexible and efficient Move VM, it delivers a specialized blockchain layer that stores metadata in a way that’s tamper-proof and perfectly aligned with the ethos of Web3 decentralization.
