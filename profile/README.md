## About

Kanari Network is an open-source project that leverages the **Move Virtual Machine (Move VM)** to revolutionize file metadata management in Web3. It addresses the critical need for:
- Reliable proof of file authenticity
- Secure ownership verification
- Permissionless and trustless operation

## Key Features

- **Smart Contract Capabilities**
  - Hash validation
  - File naming management
  - Access control
  - On-chain record keeping

- **Metadata Management**
  - File ownership tracking
  - Timestamp verification
  - Version history
  - File governance
  - Immutable references

## Technical Overview

Kanari Network utilizes Move VM (from the Diem project) to:
- Execute metadata-specific smart contracts
- Create verifiable cryptographic proofs
- Maintain transparent transaction trails
- Bridge the gap between file storage and metadata management

While solutions like IPFS handle P2P file storage, Kanari Network focuses on anchoring metadata on-chain, ensuring:
- Data integrity
- Transparent versioning
- Secure access control

## Integration

Developers can easily integrate with Kanari Network through:
- Open-source libraries
- Comprehensive APIs
- Global record retrieval
- Collaborative development opportunities

The platform emphasizes:
- Security-first design
- Tamper-proof storage
- Web3 decentralization principles
